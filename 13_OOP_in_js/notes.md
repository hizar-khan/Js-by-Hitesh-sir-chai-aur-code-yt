# javsScript and classes

# Does Js have Classes
# Technically js does'nt have classes as like other programming language
# but we can says that it dose have classes but theses are based on prototyped
# js use systx of classes, bcz any other laanguage programmer tat are class-based e.g java,c++ , for them it will easily understand
# mean that js have not true classes as like other programming language, the classes in js a based on prototype-based. 
# js provide same syntax for class as other language provide but in js behind the classes their are prototypes 

## OOP - programming pradiam -- mean what is your style/structure of codeing mean what type of coder are you -- functional programming coder , oop based coding etc etc 

### Object -- in js EveryThing is object -- now what is this Object actually
# collection of properties(keys:values) and methods(ftn's)

# why need OOP whenEverThing were Going on -- due to the code massUp, code spuggti -- clean coding
# parts of OOP
-- Object literal (literally)
-- Constructor Function
-- ProtoType 
-- Classes
-- Instances (new keyWord, this)

## 4 pillart of oop
-- Abstraction (hiding details e.g fetch()) mean that oop hide the interanl details-- so you are not worry of them
-- Encapsulation -- rapping/capsule code
-- Inheritance  --  
-- Polymorphism -- poly-many morphism-styles do manythings
